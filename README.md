cafe where you can order coffee (among other menus that Velvet Cup
offers) and pay with your favorite method, including cash, Gopay, DANA, or other
QRIS providers.

edge cases.

## ðŸ¥ª Stack

This site uses Astro as the backend and API platform. Database connections and
migrations are managed by Kysely, authentication by better-auth and and Vue &
Tailwind for the frontend. Velvet Cup integrates with Midtrans for handling payments.
